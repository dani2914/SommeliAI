Wine reviewers often use opaque language entwined with colorful vocabulary to describe tastings, which makes hard classifications based on semantic description impractical; we hope to use mixture models, more specifically LDA and its hierarchical and supervised variants, to infer wine varieties (ex. Pinot Grigio) and predict ratings with natural language based reviews.
