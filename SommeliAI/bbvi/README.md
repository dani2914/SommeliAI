# Black-Box-Variational-Inference-on-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation
* This code is a direct copy of [Aodong Li's implementation of BBVI for LDA](https://github.com/aodongli/Black-Box-Variational-Inference-on-Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation), which is itself largely a copy of [David Blei's lda-c implementation](https://github.com/blei-lab/lda-c) exactly.  We make NO CLAIM the originality of this code, and the only contribution we make is to extend the variational updates
to include updates to lambda, which is excluded from Aodong Li's implementation.
