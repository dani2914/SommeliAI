Title: SommeliAI -- Wine Tasting with Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Background
Wine reviewers often use opaque language entwined with colorful vocabulary to describe tastings, which makes hard classifications based on semantic description impractical; we hope to use mixture models, more specifically LDA and its hierarchical and supervised variants, to infer wine varieties (ex. Pinot Grigio) and predict ratings with natural language based reviews.

Subtitle: Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- show plate notation
- show math?

Subtitle: Data
- explain dataset
- show graph of document id (x) vs. document word count (y)
  - or histogram with document word count(x) vs. # of docs (y)
- show example wine review corpus

Subtitle: Simple LDA run with standard procedure for stop words etc
- model
  - short blurb 
- inference
  - short blurb
- criticism
  - show clusters of words ("word cloud") where topic clusters are similar
  - show classification results for each corpus

Subtitle: LDA run removing top common word speciic to our corpus
- criticism
  - show clusters of words (hopefully better)
  - show classification results for each corpus
  - show wine review corpus example with word highlighted by topic
