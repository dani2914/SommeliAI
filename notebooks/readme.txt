This folder is for scripts and notebooks
    We can make a bunch of different scripts / notebook sections as .py files,
        and put all imports in the __init__.py file
    That way we can keep our imports organized while we build out different parts of the presentation
    You can run your file (e.g. example.py in ipython as %run example.py), 
        but i think if you do python example.py in the command line it will complain about the from . import *

Once everything is done, we can organize it all into a big jupyter notebook
